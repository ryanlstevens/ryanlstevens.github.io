I am currently Director of Applied Sciences at Ramp, leading a team of Applied Scientists and Analytics Engineers. Our teams build the core ML models and data products powering Risk Management and Growth at Ramp. Prior to joining Ramp, I worked as a Data Scientist at Meta on their Ads Core ML team. Before that, I completed my Economics PhD at New York University. My academic research interests were primarily focused on industrial organization, applied econometrics and behavioral economics. Outside of work, I like to code, play around with interesting datasets, bike around, and spend time with my wife and our pup, Archie.
